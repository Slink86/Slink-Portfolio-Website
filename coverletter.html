                    I am writing to express my interest in the Network Engineer position at your organization. As a <mark>U.S. Army Veteran</mark> and experienced IT Support Specialist, I bring over a decade of hands-on experience in maintaining and enhancing network infrastructure, providing tiered technical support, and managing enterprise systems with a focus on performance, security, and user satisfaction.

                <p class="margin">
                    During my time at FasPsych, LLC and Amazon Web Services, I managed Active Directory environments, optimized O365 administration, and supported VoIP systems. I’ve worked closely with network equipment and tools such as iperf, MTR, and traceroute, which has given me a robust foundation in diagnosing and resolving network issues. My dedication to excellence in service delivery has been recognized through measurable improvements in ticket resolution times and customer satisfaction scores.
                </p>

                <p class="margin">
                    I am currently completing a Bachelor of Science in Network Engineering and Security from WGU and hold certifications including CCNA and CompTIA A+. My goal is to leverage this strong technical foundation in a Network Engineer role where I can continue contributing to efficient and secure infrastructure development.
                </p>

                <p class="margin">
                    I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background can contribute to your team. Thank you for your time and consideration.
